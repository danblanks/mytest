# mytest

This is the code test for the mercedes interview

CpuForm.[cpp,h] contain the core code for the application, including reading the file and displaying it in a QTextEdit widget.

I don't have a Linux system at home, so I downloaded a sample file from the web and used that as my sample file. The powerpoint file in the attached shows a screen shot of my simple GUI.
 
I didn't do it in QML because as I mentioned, I haven't worked QML yet. But I think the hard part is pulling in the file stream properly. Displaying it is the easy part.
 
Given time, I can get the QML version. If I was doing a more user-friendly desktop version, I would display this in a table, but time was too short to do a good job of that. Tables can be a bit tricky. So I just used a simple text editing field. I know the same thing can be done in QML.
