This is the code test for the mercedes interview

CpuForm.[cpp,h] contain the core code for the application for displaying the file in a text area.

The latest update changed the newmain.cpp to demonstrate a QML version of the application. This should display a simple QML text box with the contents of the file.

Additional files are the newresource.qrc resource file and the view.qml file.
